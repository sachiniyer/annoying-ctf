# Annoying CTF

I had a challenge with my roommate @amino to make a ctf, so I did. (Currently trying to find a safe way to deploy this.)


# Installation Instructions
1. Replace `env.example` and `html/env.example` with proper values
2. Run `make` (expects python3) -> this makefile is not extensively tested. Use the clean function with caution
3. Make sure docker and docker compose are installed
4. Run `docker compose up -d`

# Description
This challenge has around 3 stages. It requires patience, waiting, and some guessing. Think outside the box/container. The line between when to brute force and when to create an elegant solution is blurry.

Also, there are some keys, they don't do anything really expect in this ctf.
