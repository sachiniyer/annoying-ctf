# Annoying CTF

I had a challenge with my roommate @amino to make a ctf, so I did.


# Installation Instructions
1. Run `make` (expects python3) -> this makefile is not extensively tested. Use the clean function with caution
2. Make sure docker and docker compose are installed
3. Run `docker compose up -d`
